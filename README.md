# 🔐 Password Generator

A small password generator web app built to solve a **real everyday need**: generating random passwords quickly and easily.

The app allows the user to generate a password based on a chosen length and includes simple interactions to generate, copy, and reset the result.

## 📌 About the project

This project was built to address a real use case while working on JavaScript logic and UI behavior.

The focus was on keeping the logic clear, separating responsibilities in the code, and designing an interface that is simple and functional, without unnecessary complexity.
